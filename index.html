The very high risk assessment applies to PNG. For preparedness and response planning purposes, the following factors were also considered in Papua New Guinea:
	                <ul>
		            <li>PNG is geographically accessible by air, sea and land through its point of entry.</li>
		            <li>PNG health system has limited capacity and resources to manage potential large-scale response.</li>
	                <li>Given the high profile nature of the outbreak and with the massive coverage in international and social media, the public risk perception is high. The PNG public is concerned and has strong opinions on the health measures that need to be in place.</li>
