                    	Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms.<br> Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility.
                    	
                    	People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.
                    	
                    	On average it takes 5-6 days from when someone is infected with virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.

                    <p>
                    	People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with the virus. This is why it is important to stay at least 1 meter away from others.
                    	<br>
                    	These droplets can land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails. People can become infected-by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. This is why it is important to wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean with alcohol based hand rub.
