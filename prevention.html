	The government of Papua New Guinea banned all travelers from Asian countries and closed its borders from Indonesia, taking effect from 30th of January. On the 16th of June due to additional cases in the National Capital District (NCD) and the Western Province, the Emergency Controller issued National Emergency Order No.16, effectively locking down the National Capital District. The order established an 8pm-6am curfew, prohibiting most public gathering, limited groups to four people, banning public transportation, and suspending alcohol and betel nut sales. The order also prohibited domestic air travel and closed public venues such gambling halls, night clubs, religious services, sports and sport clubs.

<H2><i>Protecting yourself and others from the spread of COVID-19</i></H2>
<hr>
<H3><i>You can reduse your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:</i></H3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your clean your hands with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or 
	alcohol based hand rub kills that may be on your hands. </li>
<li>Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain the virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease. </li>
<li>Avoid going to crowded places. Why? When people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COVID-19 and is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 mater (3 feet). </li>	
<li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick the virus. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth.
From there the virus can enter your body and infect you. </li>
<li>Make sure you and people around you, follow respiratory hygiene. this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose the used tissue and immediately wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect yourself and the people around you from COVID-19. </li>
<li>Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your home, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19. </li>
<li>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local health authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health care facility. </li>
<li>Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves. </li>
